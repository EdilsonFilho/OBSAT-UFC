## OBSAT - UFC 

The purpose of this repository is to keep information about the AUTOSAT project that is competing in the 1st Brazilian Satellite Olympiad. Our project consists of two main experiments. 1- Use blockchain for data protection and for cryptobootloader on nanosatelites. 2- Carry out fault tolerance tests on data stored in the satellite memory.



### Resume
South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly (AMAS) is a kind of lag in protection magnetic of our planet located more specifically in the south and southeast regions of Brazil
and which extends to the south of the African continent. Space agencies around the world have warned for the importance of understanding this phenomenon that directly affects space devices that
cross this region. ESA warned of the gradual growth of distortion since the decade of 70. According to studies published in 2020, the Earth has lost 9% of its strength in the last 200 years,
the biggest impact being concentrated on AMAS. Satellites and other devices and spacecraft, by pass through the AMAS disturbance region, suffer from loss of radiation protection
space causing transient failures and sometimes even permanent. In Brazil, in addition to the nanosatellite launched into space in March 2021, there is also two magnetic observatories that, among others
missions, aim to study and understand this anomaly. Our project aims to be an initiative original in the AMAS study, because not only we wish to carry out tests regarding tolerance to failures, but deploying new technologies and
security protocols to automate bug fixes in space applications such as automation on firmware update after failure using distributed computing concepts such as the Blockchain that has aroused interest in
big space agencies like ESA

### Research Proposal
Based on the concepts presented, we want to implement at firmware level the creation of data collection and storage routines in memories (RAM and FLASH) as well as
error detection and correction monitoring especially during the AUTOSAT pass through the AMAS region, because we believe that in this region he will be at the height of adversity in space weather, susceptible to the emergence of errors and evil
operation. We will thus be able to analyze the behavior of our solutions aiming to obtain results that allow us to generate contributions to the
scientific world and industry.

## Goals
`General`  \
-Research, plan and propose a robust solution for a low-cost onboard computer for missions from CubeSats. \
-Research the use of blockchain to perform tasks in space missions.\
-Understand how AMAS affects devices in space\

`Specific`  \
-Research and implement writing algorithms and read in RAM and FLASH memory \
-Implement the concept of smart contracts as form of interaction in nanosatellite constellations \
-Share research results and implementations carried out. \
